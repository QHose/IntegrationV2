"Multitenancy APIs";"Introduction to SaaS APIs";"To support the creation, configuration, and hydration of tenants for end customer onboarding in your applications, this series of tutorials demonstrates how the APIs can be used for:

- Tenant creation
- Tenant configuration
- Content hydration

## Create a new tenant
Using OAuth your API broker or Qlik Application automation will create a tenant for each of your customers. 
## Configure the new tenant, including:
  Configure an identity provider, typically either JSON Web Token (JWT) where integrating with existing applications, or an interactive provider such as Azure AD for other use cases
  - Pre-provision groups for access control
- Configure license and role allocations
- Create and configure security on spaces (logical buckets within a tenant for securing content)
- Configure web origin and content security policies for use with integrations or embedding

## Deploy content to the tenant, including:
- Import visualization extensions, themes and other content types required to provide customization of Qlik applications
- Import and stage Qlik applications in a shared space
- Publish staged applications to production managed spaces
- Republish updated applications";;;;;;;;

A license with multiple tenants entitlement:
Ability to create multiple tenants on that entitlement
Ability to create OAuth clients (i.e. credentials) in My Qlik

# Key principles:
1 tenant per end customer + 1 dev/ staging tenant for the OEM partner (so n customer tenants + 1)
Provisioning, configuration and hydration are driven programmatically
No (or minimal, if interactive required) manual intervention required during provisioning
All tenants are created equal

# Key components:
1 Qlik partner : 1 license*
1 license : 1 organization
1 organization : n tenants to support n end customers
1 organization : 1 set of “credentials” per Qlik Cloud region 
1 set of “credentials”: 1 bot user**

This website is completely focused in showing the key differentiators of our Qlik Sense APIs. What makes us truly unique?  
The website demonstrates a sample SaaS platform with Qlik Sense embedded. If focuses on the following topics through demos and demonstrations:
 - SaaS Provisioning: How can you embed the power of Qlik Sense  within a multi-tenant SaaS application environment. The demo shows you how you can automatically copy and distribute a Template application to each of your customers with their own data.
 - Self Service: This demo shows you the flexible possibilities of creating a personalized dashboard and report through different levels of self service.
 - Embed Qlik Sense: Qlik Sense is a software built from the ground up with the most recent web technologies. In this demo we show the different possibilities to embed Qlik Sense in your web platform.
 - Slide Generator: A collection of presentations and workshops about web, security and API integration with Qlik Sense. The slides are dynamically generated by out Engine API.  
 - Integration Questions? : Here you can find further in depth documentation and videos about integrating Qlik Sense in your platform.";;;;;;;;

In the end you want to provide an integrated view of Qlik Sense in your software. The user should be able to access only his authorized data in a seamless way.

The cloud hub is a collaborative environment for developing and sharing content.

Use shared spaces to develop and share content with other members of your cloud hub. You can also share your personal apps with other cloud hub members. Use notes to capture and share insights.

Make sure you check out the demo section in the top menu and select the self service demo. ";;;;;;;;

The left side of the screen will show the 'broker'. This is a software capability that is already in place and manages the current SaaS platform. This piece of software will maintain the control of the SaaS platform and will communicate with our Sense platform through our APIs. This means that the control stays completely in the existing platform.

In this demo, the broker will define following parameters:
 - Which customers need access to the applications?
 - What will be the roles and the access rights to the apps?
 - Which apps should be provided?";;;;;;;;

<p> This demo shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a ""template layout"" for each of your customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.

 In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The left side shows ""the broker"" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                            <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button, you also select an ""app"" to be used as a template for the layout.</li>
         <li><b>Select your apps</b> Which apps do your customers need to receive?</li>
                            <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                            <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the ""row level security"" app in the ""everyone stream"". This demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group membership.</li>
                        </ol> </p>";;;;;;;;

In our  'Embedding Qlik Sense' demo we have embedded  different parts of Qlik Sense.
On the left side of the screen you can choose which example you want to see. On the right side you will see the result.
Basically there are 3 main ways of embedding Qlik Sense:
 - Through an IFrame: This method allows to embed the full hub, a complete app, a complete sheets or a collection of multiple objects. It allows Qlik Sense to be embedded is a fast and easy way. When using IFrame you are using the layout and objects defined in Qlik Sense. Note that you can change the colors and fonts using ""themes"".
 - With Div tags you have the possibility to embed individual Qlik Sense objects like charts in a web page.  A Div tag is nothing more than a reserved place on a webpage. This allows you to make a customized webpage in which you can have your own layout and functionality.
- Finally you can use Qlik Sense APIs to get the data to be used by your own vizalization library. The JavaScript charts can be built on the fly through our APIs or via external visualizations libraries(Eg. D3 charts)";;;;;;;;
